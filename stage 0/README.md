# 🌟 HNG Frontend Stage 0 — Testable Profile Card

This is my submission for **Frontend Wizards — Stage 0 Task** of the **HNG Internship**.  
The task was to build an accessible, semantic, and responsive **Profile Card** using only **HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript**.

---

## 🔍 **Project Overview**

The Profile Card displays:
- 👤 My name and short biography  
- 🕒 Current UTC time (in hours, minutes, and seconds)  
- 🖼️ Avatar image  
- 🌐 Social links (Twitter, GitHub, LinkedIn)  
- 🎨 Hobbies and dislikes  

All elements include the required **`data-testid`** attributes so automated tests can detect them.

## 🧠 **Core Features**

✅ Semantic and accessible HTML (uses `<article>`, `<header>`, `<section>`, `<nav>`, `<figure>`)  
✅ Fully responsive layout using Flexbox  
✅ Current time updates every second  
✅ External links open safely in new tabs (`target="_blank"`, `rel="noopener noreferrer"`)  
✅ Hobbies and dislikes displayed as text (no list bullets)  
✅ Clean, minimalist color theme with smooth hover effects
